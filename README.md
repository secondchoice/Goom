# Goom - A WAD viewer in Swift

![Goom window](Images/goom.png)

Goom is a basic **viewer** (not a game!) of WAD files (the Doom data files). It is a short Swift program demonstrating a
modern implementation of these old-school techniques.

## Install

### Compile and run

Open the Xcode project, select the macOS or iOS target, and compile and run.

### Use other WADs

The build process automatically download the shareware `doom1.wad` into `Assets/`. You can replace this with other Doom
WADs.
